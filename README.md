# Ibislayer

## What is This Project

The Ibislayer Project, although has nothing to do with Ibis slaying, uses a Leap Motion device to fly a Parrot AR Drone 2.0. Using IR sensors and a basic UI system, it is possible to fly the drone with or without visual line of sight. The drone also has a seperate mode called automatic avoidance system, where the drone be set to take off and then avoid objects that come within 30 cm of its range.

## Project Hardware Requirements

- Leap Motion
- Parrot Ar Drone 2.0 (Any edition)
- 5x IR senors
- Raspberry Pi Zero W (Weight is the main consideration so the Zero W is the preference, though any Pi with WiFi communcations can work)
- Arduino (We use Arduino Uno, however it is also possible to use an any other Arduino with 5 Analog Inputs)
- Computer
