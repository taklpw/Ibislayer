# Ibislayer

The Ibislayer Project uses a Leap Motion device to fly a Parrot AR Drone 2.0. Using IR sensors and a basic UI system, it is possible to fly the drone with or without visual line of sight. The drone also has a seperate mode called automatic avoidance system, where the drone be set to take off and then avoid objects that come within 30 cm of its range.
